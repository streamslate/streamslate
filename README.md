✨ Why StreamSlate?

Teaching live, reacting to research papers, or breaking down patch notes on stream usually means fumbling with clunky viewers or overlay hacks. StreamSlate gives you a purpose-built workspace that:
	•	Stays invisible until you need it – auto-hiding chrome and a one-click Presenter Mode keep the focus on content, not UI.
	•	Loves the dark – true dark-mode page inversion + neon/pastel highlight palette pop on camera without glare.
	•	Plugs straight into OBS / StreamYard / vMix – local WebSocket server and optional NDI output make scene setup trivial.
	•	Runs light – powered by Tauri + PDF.js; <10 MB install and <80 MB RAM with a 100-page PDF.

🖥️  Quick Start

Using Pre-built Releases
	1.	Grab the latest .dmg / .msi / .AppImage from Releases.
	2.	Install and launch StreamSlate.
	3.	Drag a PDF onto the window or run:

streamslate MyDeck.pdf


	4.	In OBS, Add → Browser Source pointing to http://localhost:11451/presenter?token=YOUR_TOKEN.

Building From Source

Requires Node ≥ 20, cargo + Rust stable, and make.

git clone https://github.com/streamslate/streamslate.git
cd streamslate
npm install
npm run tauri dev  # hot-reload during development

The first build will compile the Tauri (Rust) side – subsequent runs are much faster.
